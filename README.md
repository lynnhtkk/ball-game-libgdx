# LibGDX Blocks and Ball Game

This project is a simple game created using the LibGDX framework in Java. It follows a tutorial to implement a classic blocks and ball game where the user controls a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy blocks.

## Project Overview

The game consists of the following elements:

- **Blocks:** Positioned at the top of the screen, these are the targets that the ball needs to hit.
- **Ball:** Moves around the screen, bouncing off the paddle, blocks, and screen borders.
- **Paddle:** Controlled by the user with the cursor, the paddle is used to bounce the ball.

## Gameplay

- The goal is to control the paddle and bounce the ball to hit and destroy the blocks.
- When the ball touches the blocks, they get destroyed, and the ball changes direction.
- The same happens when the ball collides with the paddle.
- If the ball hits the screen borders, its direction changes to maintain continuous gameplay.

## Development

This project is a work in progress, and further development is planned. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

## Tutorial Reference

The implementation of this game follows a tutorial available [here](https://colourtann.github.io/HelloLibgdx/index.html). The tutorial provides step-by-step guidance on creating a blocks and ball game using the LibGDX framework.
